            <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">In recent years and specifically during the Covid’19 period, poor mental health has been the most pervasive. Bad mental health can affect every aspect of life. High levels of anxiety and depression are being reported which are even worsened by the isolation and loneliness during the pandemic. Moreover with increasing use of social media, mood disorders and sucide related outcomes have increased significantly. In September 2020, the rate of moderate to severe anxiety peaked with over 8 in 10 people who took an anxiety screen scoring moderate to severe symptoms.</p>
